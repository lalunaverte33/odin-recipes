    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.
            Place a rack on the upper third of the oven. Line a roasting pan or thick baking sheet with foil. Rub some olive oil or canola oil over the foil to keep the wings from sticking.</li>
        <li>Prepare the marinade sauce:
            Whisk together the marinade ingredients—soy sauce, honey, grated ginger, garlic, hot sauce—in a bowl. Set aside half of the marinade to be used as a sauce (about 1/4 cup).</li>
        <li>Toss the wings with marinade, place on pan:
            Place the chicken wings in a bowl and toss with the remaining marinade. Arrange the wings, skin-side down, on the foil-lined roasting pan, taking care not to crowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the oven:
            Roast for 15 minutes, then remove from oven, use tongs to turn the wings over so that they are now skin-side up, and roast for another 10 minutes, until nicely browned. Check while roasting to make sure they aren't getting too dark. If so, place on a lower rack or cover with foil to finish cooking.</li>
            <li>Toss with the reserved marinade sauce:
            Place cooked wings in a bowl and toss with the reserved marinade sauce.</li>
    </ol>
